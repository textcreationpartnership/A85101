            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe late welcome intelligence from the Kingdome of Ireland, doth not a little enbourage the faithfull and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous hearts of the Kingdome of England, but begins to diſſolve, the unſavory miſts, and fulſome Clouds, that hath ſo much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed the hearts of the Engliſh party: but now we hope to ſee a perfect appearance, and by the Ayd and Aſsiſtance of the two Covenanted Kindgdomes, to heare of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159970:3"/>happy vanquiſhing of the potent and Popiſh party in Ireland, which (already) begins to give a Glorious glimpſe to theſe two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, as will appeare by the happy arrivall of the laſt Poſt from Ireland, retaking the gallant ſucceſſe of the Engliſh Forces as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>Richard Gifford</hi> is not taken, nor hurt, nor any of quality, onely a Cornet of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> was taken, but reſtored ſince: When the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> went to viſit the Nuntio, after unworthy uſage a Troope of Horſe was ſent after to kill him, if they overtooke him, from which he eſcaped narrowly by riding all night: <hi>Thou ſetteſt them in ſlippery places:</hi> My Lord <hi>Digby</hi> would fain paſſe to <hi>France,</hi> but thar he is hindered by the Parliaments ſhips on the one ſide, and the Nuntio on the other, who will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to go, unleſſe he take an Oath to act nothing prejudiciall to his deſignes.</p>
               <p>The Popiſh Iriſh Lords and Gentlsmen are grown too ſtrong for the Clergy, and have turned them out of their connſels (a good univerſall worke) and have ſent for the Lords <hi>Caſtle Haven, Taffe,</hi> and <hi>Dillon,</hi> with others, to come thither, intending to put the Nuntio out of the Kingdome, and its but reaſon, for he ſaid
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159970:4"/>that <hi>Ireland</hi> was given by the Pope to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to be <hi>Dominus Hiberniae,</hi> upon condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Romane Religion, and if the King will not doe ſo, his holtneſſe will look out a new tenant; but he muſt do no more then look to make him hold poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, the heards of naked people over whom the Clergy have power to adhere to him, The Nuntio outed, they goe on for a peace, or truce. The Earle of <hi>Clamorgun,</hi> Governour of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and a poore one in purſe and power, attends their reſolutions.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond</hi> is about 4000 horſe and foot, of which are ſome hundreds Cavaliers, <hi>Preſton</hi> betweene 6. and 7000. <hi>Owen Roe Oneale</hi> about 8000. If all theſe joyne, being neare 20000. the Parliament muſt ſend a great power, and that muſt be attended by a great Fleet laden with Proviſions, but of their accord there is ſome queſtion to be made.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of the difference, or not cloſing all this while, is becauſe <hi>Ormond</hi> will not ſuffer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to have any intereſt in Dublin, Tredaugh, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places he holds.</p>
